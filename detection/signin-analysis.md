# Sign-In Log Analysis

Identity sign-in logs were reviewed to identify abnormal authentication behavior.

The analysis focused on:
- Repeated failed sign-in attempts
- Temporal clustering of authentication failures
- Source IP and geographic context
- Client application used during authentication

A pattern of failed sign-ins for a single user account was identified and selected for further investigation.
